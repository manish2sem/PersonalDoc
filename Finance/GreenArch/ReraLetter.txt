Comment: Hi,

I stay in Bangalore and made a purchase of 3 BHK apartment in Noida (Savior Green Arch)
Final demand letter was issued on mid of December 2017.
There was mistake on calculation in demand letter (Final calculation was showing 65,000 more to pay)
I brought this matter to green arch CRM team.
They accepted the issue and said it would be rectified within two three days.
After repeated reminder and continuous followup, they issued new demand letter on March 15 2018, but imposed late payment charges. I immediately reverted back to them on this matter and they sent me another demand letter on march 20 2018. This was correct on all respect.
I made the payment by April 19 2018. They provided us the date 5th May for collecting NOC.
When we approached for NOC they again asked us for the payment of late charges when we objected for that then they didn't issue NOC and stopped co operating us.
As I was in Bangalore,it was difficult to communicate as they stopped responding my calls. 

Please advise.

Regards,
Manish
