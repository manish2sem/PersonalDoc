Hi Kuldeep,

Today, My representative (Preety Singh) went to collect the NOC and came to know that it has been on hold, because of late payment charge.

Just to remind you the reason of this late payment (which was due on dec 28 dec) was green-arch management.

To make it clear I am putting the events in chronological order as below :
 I received the demand letter in first week of January.
 I found the difference  in total payable( 41,04,553 ) and actual payable ( 40,43,201 ) and brought it in your notice on jan 15 through mail.
 You promised me that it would be rectified soon and I would receive fresh demand letter. 
But it took more than 2 month to generate fresh demand letter which i received on second week of March.
In this demand letter again i noticed extra charges as late payment fee.
Again we had the telephonic conversation on this after that you promised me to send me new demand letter without extra charges.
Finally 0n 20th March i recevied demand letter without interest and same day i made the RTGS of 11,66,177.
On march 21st, a checque bearing 284000 was couriered to Preety whcin see handed over to Kamini  on somewhere last week of March.
This cheque was returned back the it was payble to Axis bank.
I came to know this through Kamini on
Immeditaely process of new cheque was initiated and sent to preety whci see handed over to you on last week of April.






On April 


recevied 
 and repeated telephonic conversation.
